mangos-zero server [![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/mangoszero/server/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/mangoszero/server/latest)
==================

**mangos-zero** is an Open Source GPL version 2 licensed server for running your
own instance of the [World of Warcraft][wow], specifically of [vanilla WoW][wow-1].

The ultimate goal of the project is to preserve the game in its' first released
version and allow players to relive the experience of the original game, since
the game is always evolving and being updated with new content.

If you are nostalgic or just missed out on the early days of World of Warcraft,
stay with us, as [vanilla WoW][wow-1] is right here.
